I’m taking this opportunity to share a little bit about what I’ve been up to over the past few years.</p> <p class=\"mb-4\">Currently, I’m working as the <a href=\"https://www.noarcloud.com/\" class=\"text-white underline\">Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Noar Cloud</a>, a company that develops cloud computing solutions. Noar’s goal is to enable people to use the power of cloud computing with the ease of a personal computer. My main responsibility is leading the technical team, working on both the development of solutions and strategic decisions for the company. One of the most interesting projects I lead is integrating different cloud providers, such as AWS and Google Cloud, which has made our platform more efficient and scalable. Today, we serve over 48,000 users, with daily peaks of up to 400 accesses. This challenge has been a great opportunity for both learning and personal fulfillment, blending technical work with leadership responsibilities.</p> <p class=\"mb-4\">Before Noar Cloud, I worked at <a href=\"https://www.itau.com.br/\" class=\"text-white underline\">Itaú Unibanco</a> as a back-end engineer, where I contributed to the development of an investment management app called ION. One of the biggest achievements of this project was reducing the time to update client portfolios, which began to be updated daily, greatly improving the user experience. Additionally, we worked on integrating real-time data, making the app even more accurate in its recommendations for investors. It was a highly productive period and one of great professional growth for me.</p> <p class=\"mb-4\">My journey at <a href=\"https://www.itau.com.br/\" class=\"text-white underline\">Itaú Unibanco</a> began as a Junior Engineer, where I had the opportunity to modernize the credit management system. Our team migrated an old system to a cloud-based architecture, bringing more agility and efficiency to data management. This experience taught me a lot about balancing new technologies with the need to maintain secure and reliable operations.</p> <p class=\"mb-4\">My first professional experience was at <a href=\"https://www.enext.com.br/\" class=\"text-white underline\">Enext Consultoria</a>, where I started as a trainee and later worked as a back-end developer. There, I worked on e-commerce platforms, helping to develop automated and customized solutions for major marketing campaigns, such as Black Friday. It was a period when I learned a lot about automation and process optimization to ensure everything worked perfectly during high-traffic events.</p> <p class=\"mb-4\">I graduated in Computer Science from <a href=\"https://unasp.br\" class=\"text-white underline\">UNASP - Centro Universitário Adventista de São Paulo</a>, and I have been specializing in languages and tools such as Java, Python, Node.js, in addition to databases like MongoDB and PostgreSQL. I also have extensive experience with cloud computing tools like Docker and Kubernetes, which are part of my daily work on the projects I develop.</p> <p class=\"mb-4\">I’ve learned a lot and am always seeking new challenges that help me grow even further. What I enjoy most about my work is the opportunity to solve complex problems and create solutions that make a difference for users, always with an eye toward the future and growth.</p> <p class=\"mb-4\">I hope you enjoyed learning a little more about what I’ve been up to. I’m really happy to share this part of my life with you. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to chat more!</p> <p class=\"mb-4\">With care,</p> <p class=\"font-signature text-4xl\">João Rosa</p>"
